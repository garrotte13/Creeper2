Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2020.05.12
  Beta:
    - Purge the creep by fire, setting huge swaths of it aflame. With
      the release, it brings two new settings--enable creep burnination
      and wildfire mode. Additionally, the biomass of the creep alters
      the flames' hue.
    - This is a BETA feature. It's performant ("It works for me!"),
      even with the wildfire setting enabled. Currently, flame spreads
      only if initiated by the personal flamethrower or a flame turret.
      Other sources of flames (burning trees, tank flamethrower, atomic
      bombs) do not start blazes. Future releases will handle these
      events, along with the anti-matter bomb wiping out creep patches.
      Be warned that creep blazes will spread to structures and trees.
    - Feedback requested if you observe performance issues or other bugs.
